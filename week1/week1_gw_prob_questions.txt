Explain the difference between an experiment and a trial.
    An experiment is a repeatable process used to gather clearly defined results. A trial is a single occurence of an experiment providing
    one result. An experiment is made up of multiple trials.

Explain the difference between an outcome and an event.
    An outcome is a result of a trial and an event is a group of outcomes that are of interest.

Come up with a real world example of each perspective of probability (classical, empirical, and subjective) that was not mentioned in class.
    Classical: 
        predicting the probability of a couple's first child being a boy or girl using the overall ratio of humans having a boy or girl.

    Empirical:  
        predicting the probability of a couple's fifth child being a boy or girl using the boy to girl ratio of the couples other four children.

    subjective:
        A couple guessing whether they will have a boy or girl based on intuition.

Explain the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics.
    descriptive statistics describes data that is present and inferential statistics is used to make generalizations about a population
    using a sample. 

Explain the difference between frequentist and Bayesian statistics.
    frequentist statistics draws conclusions of how often an occurence will happen from sample data and Bayesian statistics assigns a probability
    to a hypothesis and updates its probability as new information comes in.
